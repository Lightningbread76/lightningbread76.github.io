              because I wanted to work on rockets and contribute to mankind's exploration of the stars. 
              But I soon realized that my skills in programming and problem solving were much better than my chemistry and calculus skills. So I switched to Computer Science as a major.

              Iâ€™ve done a variety of projects in different fields in Computer Science, my most notable ones are the Note taking android app(Checkmate) and an interactive web book website. 
              What I can bring to the table is a deep understanding in clean code standards, Object Oriented Programming, HTML/CSS,  javascript, MATLAB, efficient testing, MongoDB and Firebase. 
              I also have experience in python, R, and the agile development workflow from my past internships and courses at Boston University."

              text1="I am a fast learner, especially when I come to develop a passion for the subject. My favorite method of learning is pair programming as we can not only share and exchange our knowledge but also create a sense of understanding and comradeship. 
              One of my strengths is having the ability to recognize who is best in their field while working in a team environment and I often use that intuition to maximize efficiency and productivity as a leader."
